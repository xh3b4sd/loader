# loader
Loader generates go code containing loaded assets. It was originally developed
to support the Anna project. See https://github.com/xh3b4sd/anna for more
information.

Using loader arbitrary files can be embedded into go source code. This is like
https://github.com/jteeuwen/go-bindata but not binary safe. Only use this for
UTF-8 files.

For code documentation see https://godoc.org/github.com/xh3b4sd/loader.

I do not use `go-bindata` for various other tools like that for the following
reasons.
- `golint` will complain about the code generated by certain tools. `loader`
  aims to only generate `golint` friendly code.
- `gofmt` will complain about the code generated by certain tools. `loader`
  aims to only generate `gofmt` friendly code.

To install the binary simply do the following.
```
go get github.com/xh3b4sd/loader
```

To embed files put the following comment into your source code.
```
//go:generate loader generate
```

When running within a CI system you might see this error.
```
running "loader": exec: "loader": executable file not found in $PATH
```

In this case the following should do the trick.
```
//go:generate ${GOPATH}/bin/loader generate
```

To generate code do the following.
```
go generate
```
