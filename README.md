# loader
Loader generates go code containing loaded assets. That way arbitrary files can
be embedded into go source code. This is like
https://github.com/jteeuwen/go-bindata but not binary safe. Only use this for
UTF-8 files.

I do not use `go-bindata` or various other tools like that for the following
reasons.
- `golint` will complain about the code generated by certain tools. `loader`
  aims to only generate `golint` friendly code.
- `gofmt` will complain about the code generated by certain tools. `loader`
  aims to only generate `gofmt` friendly code.
